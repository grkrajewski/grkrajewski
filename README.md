Hi, my name is Grzegorz. I have finished Bootcamp Java Developer Plus. I still develop my skills by taking new trainings and courses.

Here is my repository which is either my portfolio. It is the place where I will store all my projects which will be working applications.
At the moment there is one REST API called "Food-pairing" which is still being improved.
In the near future I will try to develop the repository by putting new APIs.

Here is my Linkedin profile: www.linkedin.com/in/g-krajewski
