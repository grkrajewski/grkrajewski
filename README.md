Hi, my name is Grzegorz. I have recently finished Bootcamp Java Developer Plus.

Here is my repository which is either my portfolio. It is the place where I store my projects which are working applications.
At the moment there is only one REST API called "Food-pairing" which I will develop in the future as well as putting new ones.

Here is my Linkedin profile: linkedin.com/in/g-krajewski
